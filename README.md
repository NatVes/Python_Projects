# Python

## About

This repository contains my Python exercises completed during the Data Technician Bootcamp in Google Colab. These exercises focused on foundational programming and applied data analysis, helping me practice writing clean, efficient code, working with datasets, and solving data-driven challenges.

### 🧠 Skills Developed

During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with **Python fundamentals**, including **variables, loops, conditionals, and functions**. I also worked extensively with **lists, dictionaries, and nested data structures**, performing **data cleaning and transformation**, calculating summaries and simple statistics, and solving **logic- and data-driven challenges**. These exercises helped me develop structured, reusable code and analytical thinking.

## 📘 Python Basics

Built core programming skills through exercises focusing on:

* Data types and variables
* Control flow and decision-making
* Loops and iterations
* Functions and modular code
  
## 📘 Applied Data Analysis

Applied Python to analyse datasets and extract insights:

* Processed and filtered collections of data
* Cleaned and prepared small datasets for analysis
* Calculated key metrics and summaries
* Solved scenario-based analytical tasks
